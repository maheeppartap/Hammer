# Hammer - Fault Localization and Automatic Program repair

Welcome!

This is an under-construction repo of a much larger Automatic Program Repair tool. This is not yet fully ready, but some aspects of this work very well!

For now, only the fault localization is working. Given some C++ code, and some tests, this will find the buggy lines for you. I have implemented 12 different types of fault localizations using Similarity coefficient based techniques:
  - Kulczynski
  - Simple-Matching
  - BraunBanquet
  - Dennis
  - Mountford
  - Fossum
  - Pearson
  - Gower
  - Michael
  - Pierce
  - Baroni-Urbani/Buser
  - Tarwid
  - D*

out of all these D* is the best performing ones. If you're reading this now, you are more than welcome to use any of these, but keep in mind, this is always evolving!

The next step is to implement a good code mutation tool that can alter the source code to find something that passes the given constriants, and/or satisfies some heuristic. 

Here is an example of how this works:

Given the following code
```
bool foo(int a, int b, int c)
{
  if (c > 10){
  return a + b + c;
  }
  else {
  return a - b - c;
  }
}
```
and some set of test cases T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, we analyze every single line that executes for every single test case, and generate a IR in the form of a "coverage matrix". This looks like the following:

Using this coverage matrix, we apply the following formulas after developing some variables

Using the values generated by these formulas, we can then generate a list of suspicious lines. So for example, in the above code, D* would return the score 4 for `return a + b + c;`, which is the highest implying that the line is buggy! 
## Pre-reqs
- You will need Python
- `gcov` - This is a code coverage tool
